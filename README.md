	This project is a case study of Cyclictic, a bike sharing service. The data that was analyzed was provided by Motivate International Inc and included data collected between 02-01-2025 and 01-01-2026 under this license(https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). It answers the question, "What are the differences between Annual Members and Casual Riders?" and delivers a slide show containing data visualizations and 3 recommendations to convert Casual Riders into Annual Members.
	The data was downloaded from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html and imported into Google Sheets for exploratory data analysis and inital cleaning before being uploaded to BigQuery for final analysis. The final analysis was performed with the results then being uploaded to Tableau Public to create visualiztions which were then utilized in a Google Slides Presentation.
	The final conclusions of the analysis were that while there are differnces between Annual Members and Casual Riders, there is a subset of Casual Riders who behave like Annual Members and therefore are prime targets for conversion. The analysis also revealed seasonal trends of a decrease in overall usage during the winter months leading to a recommendation of running promotional campagins during those times as well as offering an additional membership type targeting Casual Riders who use the service more often during summer months. The final recommendation of the introduction of dynamic pricing is based on the pattern of Casual Riders usage increasing during commute times to incentivise the purchase of an Annual Membership.
